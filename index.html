            <p class="verse">
                I spoke to God today and she said that she's ashamed <br>
                What have I become, what have I done? <br>
                I spoke to the devil today and he swears he's not to blame <br>
                And I understood 'cause I feel the same
            </p>
            <p class="verse">
                Arms wide open, I stand alone <br>
                I'm no hero and I'm not made of stone <br>
                Right or wrong, I can hardly tell. <br>
                I'm on the wrong side of heaven and the righteous side of hell <br>
                I'm on the wrong side of heaven and the righteous side, <br>
                righteous side of hell
            </p>
            <p class="verse">
                I heard from God today and she sounded just like me <br>
                What have I done and who have I become <br>
                I saw the devil today and he looked a lot like me <br>
                I looked away, I turned away!
            </p>
            <p class="verse">
                Arms wide open, I stand alone <br>
                I'm no hero and I'm not made of stone <br>
                Right or wrong, I can hardly tell. <br>
                I'm on the wrong side of heaven and the righteous side of hell <br>
                I'm on the wrong side of heaven and the righteous side, <br>
                righteous side of hell
            </p>
            <p class="verse">
                I'm not defending, downward descending, <br>
                falling further and further away! <br>
                I'm closer EVERYDAY!
